Payment vs. Purchase Movie Tickets

Submit Button:
do not use Submit

ask, what do I want to do? (as in, what is the purchasers intention)

Answer: I want to buy movie tickets. Use this to name the 'submit' button.

Make it even more personal:
'Purchase My Tickets'

Form fields:
too many - not good.

ie. Newsletter sign-up... a first name and email are sufficient. More seems like 'data-mining' and seems subversive.

Clearly identify 'required fields.


Its OK to have empty space
Form fields should be in a single column. Keep path of eye tracking a straight line from top to bottom.

single input to allow for any length

Order choices logically. ABC or Breakfast, lunch, dinner

DONT use a reset button.
