            In AliExpress, they focused on turning a visitor directly into a successful client by adding colors to the specific area of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, on No. 1, they grabbed the visitor's attention by keeping it bright in color where they offer discounts. Mainly to make a visitor feel in need of the product. Then on No. 02, instead of turning this client to press the Ádd to cart button, they focused on the 'Buy Now´ button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirdly, instead of making a visitor follow the site, they prefer to suggest the person visit it instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gestalt's principle of contrast in visual hierarchy focuses on the term of making a design that is visually engaging and aesthetically appropriate to turn a target audience into a successful client. Thus, Fitts's law also focuses on making designs easier to understand for visitors.

        <p>
            Hick's law in design states that the more options available on your website, the more challenging and longer it will become for your customer to take action. It also suggests a designer orgenize their design elements to make it easier for visitors to find their needs and jump into a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at this image, you can find yourself clicking on one of the nav menu items to help you get what you need instead of searching for its features. The design is accessible and eye-catchy for viewers' action. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Pricing,' 'Templates,' and 'Wall of love' will help you know about Dorik within clicks. So, here you can say the design theme of this website has maintained a good quality of Hick's law.

        <p>
            Contrast brings meaning to a good design. A design can not be properly meaningful without adding contrast to it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Contrast can be added to a website's design in various ways. There is a range of contrast in shape, color, scale, layout, font type, alignment, etc. It makes your website more focused on its visitors' eyes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the image above, the contrast of color and shades has been used to grab the visitor's attention in the middle of the webpage.
